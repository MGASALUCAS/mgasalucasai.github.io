**Background**  
Fluorescence imitating brightfield imaging (FIBI) is a novel alternative microscopy method that can image freshly excised, non-sectioned tissue. We examine its potential utility in dermatopathology by examining readily available specimens embedded in paraffin blocks.

**Methods**  
Nine skin samples embedded in paraffin blocks were superficially deparaffinized using xylene and ethanol and stained with H&E. FIBI captured tissue surface histopathology images using simple microscope optics and a color camera. We then applied deep-learning-based models to improve resemblance to standard H&E coloration and contrast. FIBI images were compared with corresponding standard H&E slides and concordance was assessed by two dermatopathologists who numerically scored epidermal and dermal structure appearance and overall diagnostic utility.

**Results**  
Dermatopathologist scores indicate that FIBI images are at least equivalent to standard H&E slides for visualizing structures such as epidermal layers, sweat glands, and nerves.

**Conclusion**  
Images acquired with FIBI are comparable to traditional H&E-stained slides, suggesting that this rapid, inexpensive, and non-destructive microscopy technique is a conceivable alternative to standard histopathology processes especially for time-sensitive procedures and in settings with limited histopathology resources.
