As an instructor for this ongoing course, I am preparing Python notebooks and code for the class, recording lectures with other instructors and course contributors (led by Jeremy Howard), answering student questions, managing the course forum, and conducting research along the way.

The first set of lectures were released [here](https://www.fast.ai/posts/part2-2022-preview.html).
