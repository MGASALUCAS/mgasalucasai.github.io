Led two 3 hr long weekly discussion sections that involved:
- Mentoring teams for design challenge 1 & 2
- Design Challenge #1 (Rube Goldberg machine with various constraints and requirements)
- Design Challenge #2 (Assistive shoe-tying machine for hemiplegic children)
- Solidworks tutorial
- lecturing about the engineering design process
- reviewing the main lecture content
- grading quizzes and Solidworks assignment for about 50 undergrad freshman and sophomore
‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏engineering students

Mentored 11 teams for the design challenges. Out of the total 35 teams in the course, one of the teams that I mentored won the challenge.
