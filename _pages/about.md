Due to my curiosity and passion for learning, started my first college campus classes at 7-years-old. Later on graduated from high school at 10-years-old while simultaneously taking college classes. At 11-years old graduated with 3 Associate Degrees and by 12 years old was accepted as a transfer student (3rd year) to two neighboring universities UC Davis and UC Santa Cruz (Regents Scholar). Due to my love for all fields of science (biology, physics, chemistry etc) and math, I completed a Bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering at UC Davis at the age of 14 years old. At 15 years old, I started my PhD in biomedical engineering also at UC Davis. In 2019, I joined Dr. Richard Levenson's Lab. My research is focused on applying deep learning to pathology.


I am self-motivated, curious about the mechanics of things, a passionate learner, goal setter (and achieving those goals!), a hard-worker and an over-achiever. Enjoy all things science, technology, politics and sports. Love to interact and talk with people. And a role model for young and old students!
