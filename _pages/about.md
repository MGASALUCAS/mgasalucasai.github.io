I am a 19-year-old 5th-year Ph.D. candidate currently pursuing research in Biomedical Engineering at University of California, Davis. For the past 3.5 years, I have been under the supervision of Dr. Richard Levenson at the UC Davis Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. I am researching the application of deep learning (especially generative AI) to novel microscopy techniques for digital pathology. I have presented my work at several conferences (SPIE Photonics West, ICML workshop, BMES, etc.), published a book chapter, established various collaborations with labs around the world, and more. I have contributed to many open-source projects, including being on the founding team for DALL-E mini, being a frequent contributor to the fastai library, and lead developer of the UPIT library. I am also involved in various teaching initiatives, being a teaching assistant for Part 1 of the fast.ai course, and an instructor for Part 2 of the fast.ai course.

I am also a part-time employee at Stability AI. At Stability AI, I serve as a researcher for EleutherAI and CarperAI, as well as leading medical AI projects, and also serve as a social media manager (Twitter).

I am active on Twitter, mainly participating in discussions and sharing resources related to machine learning and STEM. I have amassed over 36k followers on Twitter (including leaders in the field of machine learning like Jeremy Howard, Andrej Karpathy, Jack Clark, and more), with many people finding my content useful. Check out my account here. Additionally, I have a blog related to machine learning topics. Check it out over here. I am also active in several online machine learning communities. I am a moderator for the fast.ai forums and one of the top 5 members of the community. Additionally, I am a moderator of the MLSpace Discord server with over three thousand members. Finally, I am a staff member for both CarperAI and EleutherAI. In EleutherAI, I run a highly popular diffusion model reading group.

I am also active on Kaggle, where I have received 2 silver medals and 2 bronze medals in machine learning competitions, as well as achieving Notebooks Grandmaster and Discussions Master rank. Some of the content and resources I shared have been widely used throughout the machine learning community. One of my code examples/notebooks on Kaggle was used heavily by winners of a Kaggle competition. One dataset I released on Kaggle has been used in several papers, even a Nature Machine Intelligence paper.

I have also been recognized as a child genius and a prodigy. I graduated high school at 10 years old with a 4.0 GPA. At 11 years old, I obtained 3 Associate Degrees also with a 4.0 GPA. At 14 years old, I graduated from UC Davis summa cum laude with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering. For these reasons, I have been recognized on many international and national TV, radio and print news, TV and radio talk shows, reality TV shows and documentary shows, and have been a role model for young and old students around the world.
