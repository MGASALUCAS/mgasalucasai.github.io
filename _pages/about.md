I am a 19-year-old 5th-year Ph.D. candidate currently pursuing research in Biomedical Engineering at University of California, Davis. For the past three years, I have been under the supervision of Dr. Richard Levenson at UC Davis Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. I am researching the application of deep learning (especially generative networks) to novel microscopy techniques for digital pathology. I have presented my work at several conferences, published a book chapter, established various collaborations with labs around the world, and more.

I am active on Twitter, mainly participating in discussions and sharing resources related to machine learning and STEM. I have amassed over 28k followers on Twitter (including leaders in the field of machine learning like Jeremy Howard, Andrej Karpathy, Michael Bronstein, Jack Clark, Jeff Dean, and more), with many people finding my content useful. Check out my account [here](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr). Additionally, I have started a blog last year relating to machine learning topics. Check
it out over [here](https://tmabraham.github.io/blog). I am also active in several online machine learning communities. I participate on the [fast.ai forums](https://forums.fast.ai) and one of the top 5 members of the community. Additionally, I am a moderator of the [MLSpace
Discord server](https://discord.gg/Wyc9nFCDTk) with 5000+ members. I am also active on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/tanlikesmath), where I have received 2 silver medals and 2 bronze medals in machine learning competitions, as well as achieving Notebooks Master and Discussions Master rank. Some of the content and resources I shared have been widely used throughout the machine learning community. One dataset I released on Kaggle has been used in several papers, even a Nature Machine Intelligence paper.

Finally, I have also been recognized as a child genius and a prodigy. I graduated high school at 10 years old with a 4.0 GPA. At 11 years old, I obtained 3 Associate Degrees also with a 4.0 GPA. At 14 years old, I graduated from UC Davis summa cum laude with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering. For these reasons, I have been recognized on many international and national TV, radio and print news, TV and radio talk shows, reality TV shows and documentary shows, and have been a role model for young and old students around the world.
